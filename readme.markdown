# Election Web Service

Election Web Service exposes implmentations of various election methods through
a JSON interface by way of python-vote-core. The purpose of this is to eliminate
the need to implement language-specific versions of these methods.

For example, one could calculate the results of a SchulzeSTV election in their
Java app by $erializing the ballots in JSON, making a request to the webserver,
and unserializing the results.
